# Lab-6-Group-38
Our program is a python program that asks for a name, 2 int inputs, then prints out "hello (name)" and the sum of the 2 inputs.

CODE OF CONDUCT justification: Our code is simple and asks for the user's name and for them to just input 2 numbers, so it is based on the user, their input is important to determine what the output will be.
